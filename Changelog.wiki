== Pro Version ==

v7.0.3
 * Added filters to logs (you can exclude status types that you aren't interested in).
 * Removed `log_everything` setting -- the new log filtering feature makes this option pointless.
 * Don't trigger `charge_rises` alarm if status is unplugged.  (You probably only care if you've _charged_ above your threshold, not if there's a minor fluctuation while discharging at your threshold.)
 * Significant updates to Dutch translation; some minor updates to several other translations.

v7.0.2
 * Fixed layout issue a small minority of devices were having with the Alarms screen.
 * Added new health status: "Cold".
 * Added new charging status: "Wireless".

v7.0.1
 * Updated launcher icon.  (Sorry for updating so soon for something so minor, but the new icon got pushed out with the update to Free, and I don't want Free having a better icon than Pro.)

v7.0.0
 * There are now three built-in icon sets, and the default set for Android 3.0+ (Honeycomb and newer) is now even larger than before.  The default set on older devices is the old classic set.  On the few newer devices that don't actually shrink and dim the icons, or don't do so as much as stock Android, you might prefer to select the smaller white number or the old classic set.  Plugins are still supported.
 * The newer sets with the plain number and charging indicator now make the charging indicator optional.
 * _Translations_: Added Slovenian translations.
 * _Translations_: Updated Hungarian translations.
 * Unified build process to make updates easier; removed support for API levels 3 and 4 (Android 1.5 / Cupcake and Android 1.6 / Donut) for this version forward to make this work.  The old version will continue to work for this 0.4% of users.
 * Removed !BackupAgent, at least for now, as it seemed to cause as many problems as it solved.

v6.0.3
 * This update provides a *possible* fix for users who were having trouble with the alarms. Since I don't have one of the devices with the problem, it's hard to know. If you have been having trouble with the alarms, please send me an email letting me know if this update helped or not. Thanks!

v6.0.2
 * Show separate notification when the lock screen is being disabled by the app. This can be turned off if desired.
 * Users of Jelly Bean (Android 4.1+) can set the notification priority. Set to "minimum" to hide the icon while leaving the notification in the tray. Defaults to "low" to lower the notification in the tray to allow other notifications to be more easily accessed. Set to "default" (which is Android's default, not Battery Indicator's) for normal behavior.
 * Now only displays the voltage if the reported voltage is realistic. Some devices (e.g. Nexus 7) report an invalid voltage that is no longer displayed.
 * Make the main window action bar a brighter, more noticeable gray

v6.0.1
 * Users of Android 3.0+, who have the plain number icon by default, now have a translucent rather than black icon background, due to many user requests. Don't forget you can still get the classic icons as a plugin.
 * Fixed bug with auto-disable lockscreen feature where the lockscreen would become disabled unexpectedly after first unlocking if it was never unlocked while plugged in.
 * Fixed bug in Dutch translations (my fault, not the translator's) that caused the alarms to malfunction.  (Dutch users, please let me know if you still have any problems.)
 * Minor update to Dutch translations and major update to Polish translations.

v6.0.0
 * Users of Honeycomb (Android 3.0), Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0), and up now have a different default icon set that is much easier to see on these devices.  NOTE: This only changes which icon set is used by default -- as Pro users, you can always get the new icons on an older device, or still use the old colored icons on a newer device.
 * Disabled timestamp in notification by default; added an option to reenable it.
 * Updated French, Italian, and Traditional Chinese translations.

v5.1.5
 * Added initial Lithuanian translation.
 * Updated Greek translation.

v5.1.4
 * Added complete Greek translation.
 * Fairly large update to Dutch translation.
 * Minor updates to most other translations.

v5.1.3
 * Fixed error in Brazilian Portuguese translation that was causing a force close.

v5.1.2
 * Updated Dutch and Turkish translations.
 * Clarified some help text.
 * Show percentage sign with Textual charge level feature.

v5.1.1
 * _Bugfix_: Triggered alarms were not being shown if you used an icon plugin.  They should now work perfectly with or without icon plugins.

v5.1.0
 * Updated Slovak translation.
 * Improved appearance on Droid X (and possiblity other, similar devices).
 * Long-awaited experimental single-percent increments for most devices that previously only showed ten-percent increments.  Please see [http://code.google.com/p/battery-indicator/wiki/OnePercentHack?tm=6 OnePercentHack] for more info, and to report your results.

v5.0.7
 * Updated translations (in particular, the long-standing German landend/ladend issue).
 * Disable 'colorful small' window theme.
 * Minor layout fix.

v5.0.6
 * Fixed full screen window theme so that the app completely fills the screen again.

v5.0.5
 * Improved support for Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) for Galaxy Nexus.
 * Minor layout fixes.

v5.0.4
 * Fix for a technical matter forgotten in 5.0.3 release.

v5.0.3
 * Updated Romanian, Russian, and Brazilian Portuguese translations.
 * Minor layout fixes.

v5.0.2
 * Layout fixes for most translations.

v5.0.1
 * Fixed Russian translation (it was causing a force-close for Russian-language users).

v5.0.0
 * New Feature: Icon plugins. There are just a few plugins right now, but they are very useful for black status bars, and more plugins will be coming.
 * There are also quite a few translation updates and several new translations.

v4.0.4
 * Avoid force closing on devices that don't have !BackupManager.

v4.0.3
 * Add !BackupManager support for devices that use it.
 * Update contact info and website URLs.

v4.0.2
 * Re-enable Cupcake support.

v4.0.1 (_Translations_)
 * Due to a bug in the web translation interface, many languages lost a few important translations.  The bug is now fixed, and the translations are back in this release.
 * Updated French and Italian translations.

v4.0.0
 * Initial support for Honeycomb tablets. There are more tablet optimizations planned, but this is a good start.
 * Several updated translations.
 * Automatically detect when preference summaries use a Formatter; removed manual configuration option so users don't have to deal with this.  It should "just work" now.
 * Unfortunately, I had to remove Cupcake (Android 1.5) support in order to add Honeycomb support. The reasons are complicated, annoying, and out of my control. Cupcake users can still use the previous version.

v3.1.5 (_Translations and Bugfix_)
 * Initial Czech, Hungarian, and Slovak translations.
 * Fix a Force Close bug that might have happened when connecting certain car chargers, and possibly in other situations.

v3.1.4 (_Translations_)
 * Initial French translations.

v3.1.3 (_Translations_)
 * Fixed Chinese translations for Hong Kong users

v3.1.2 (_Bugfix_)
 * This release provides a workaround for a bug in !CyanogenMod. If you use !CyanogenMod and get a Force Close when editing certain Battery Indicator settings, after upgrading you should go to Other Settings (in this app) and select the setting for *Summaries Use Formatter*.

v3.1.1 (_Bugfix_)
 * Someone managed to put a _null_ String in a place I thought one couldn't show up.  Fixed now.

v3.1.0
 * Alarms: With the new alarm feature, the app can now notify you when your battery becomes full, when the charge drops below or rises above a chosen level, if the temperature rises above a chosen level, or if the battery health fails.
 * (_Translation_) Partial French translations.
 * (_Translation_) Updated Italian translations.
 * (_Translation_) Fix error in Simplified Chinese translations.

v3.0.6 (_Translations_)
 * (_Translation_) Add Italian translations.

v3.0.5 (_Translations_)
 * (_Translation_) Fix Traditional Chinese translations.

v3.0.4 (_Translations_)
 * (_Translation_) Add Spanish translations.
 * (_Translation_) Add Traditional Chinese translations.

v3.0.3
 * (_Bugfix_) Remove FLAG_ACTIVITY_RESET_TASK_IF_NEEDED from Intent used to launch Battery Use screen. It doesn't appear to be necessary, and it caused a problem on at least one user's phone (which is a Droid X, but don't know if that's relevant).
 * (_Bugfix_) Some phones fluctuate wildly in their reported charge.  This causes Battery Indicator to think either that the phone has been charged or that a fuller battery has been put in.  I've adjusted the threshold to hopefully work well both for those with phones that fluctuate and for those who carry spare batteries.  With this version, a jump of 30 points or more is guaranteed to trip the switch, while a jump of 20 points or fewer is guaranteed not to. (For 21-29, it just depends on the situation).
 * (_Translation_) Add Chinese translations.

v3.0.2 (_Bugfix_)
 * (_Bugfix_) Auto-disable keyguard properly: User has to manually dismiss the keyguard once, then it will be disabled. This is both more secure (for secure screen locks) and fixes a bug that was present in various forms with all screen locks (including 'None').
 * (_Bugfix_) Make sure database is always closed properly.

v3.0.1
 * Log temperature and voltage, too.
 * Ability to export logs to CSV on SD card.
 * Option to close main window immediately after launching Battery Use screen.
 * Option to disallow manual lock screen disable.
 * A handful of minor tweaks and improvements throughout.

v3.0.0
 * Estimated discharge / charge time left. (Optional)
 * Logging of battery state. (Optional)
 * Themes for the main window. (Optional)
 * Manually/automatically dis/reenable the device lock screen. (Optional)
 * Efficiency improvements throughout.
 * Actually _smaller_ despite all the new features.
 * A "soft reset" of the service when you change settings, so the icon doesn't blink.
 * Green down to 20% (previous limit was 30%).
 * It now notices if a fuller battery has been put in, or if the phone was charged while off.
 * Trimmed down interface, moving many things to a menu.
 * So many new settings that they've been broken into multiple, easier to use pages.
 * Help pages explaining all of the settings.
 * Option to show the charge as larger text (only in notification tray).
 * Color preview.
