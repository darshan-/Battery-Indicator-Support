<h1>The One-Percent Hack</h1>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

== Summary ==

Many (most?) Motorola devices only show the battery level as a
multiple of 10% by default.  There is now an option to attempt a
workaround.  It is in the "Other Settings" page of the Battery
Indicator Pro settings, at the bottom.  It has also been added
the the settings page of the Free version.

I need your help to test it out and report back in the comments on
issue 54.

== Technical Details ==

For some strange reason, Motorola decided to only show the battery
level in 10-percent increments on most of their Android devices.
However, many of these devices have a file at
`/sys/class/power_supply/battery/charge_counter` that contains the
current charge level to the nearest single percent.  (My understanding
is that this is not what this file is suppoed to be used for.
Non-crippled devices often don't have the file, and when they do, they
use it accorinding to the linux documention, which describes a
different purpose -- so in those cases the file does not contain the
battery level.)

I originally assumed that I would need to set up a timer to trigger
the Battery Indicator Service to wake up and check that file at
regular intervals.  Luckily (and *very* strangely), at least on the
Droid X, the standard ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED Broadcast Intent is
actually sent upon every 1-percent change -- down to the temperature
and voltage details.  In other words, they still send the Broadcast
just as often as non-crippled devices, with everything except the
current actual charge level (the thing most people are most interested
in).  That's unexpected, but if this is how all of these crippled
devices work, at least it keeps the workaround very simple.

Based on the reports I've received so far, that (thankfully) appears
to be the case.

== Device Status ==

This is a partial list of devices that only show multiples of 10% by
default, along with their status with the hack.  If your device isn't
listed or has an unknown status, please test the hack and add a
comment to issue 54 to let me know what you found.

|| *Device* || *Status* ||
|| Motorola Defy || _*Probably works*_, since the Defy+ does. ||
|| Motorola Defy+ || Reportedly *works perfectly* with the hack enabled. ||
|| Motorola Droid (original) || The hack does *not* help. ||
|| Motorola Droid 2 || Reportedly *works perfectly* with the hack enabled. ||
|| Motorola Droid 3 || Reportedly *works perfectly* with the hack enabled. ||
|| Motorola Droid Bionic || Reportedly *works perfectly* with the hack enabled. ||
|| Motorola Droid Razr || Reportedly *works perfectly* with the hack enabled. ||
|| Motorola Droid X || *Works perfectly* with the hack enabled. ||
|| Motorola Droid X2 || _Unknown_ ||
|| Motorola Electrify || Reportedly *works perfectly* with the hack enabled. ||
|| Motorola Photon || _*Probably works*_, since the Electrify does. ||
|| Samsung Moment || _Unknown_ ||

`*` Note that the 'Droid' name is is often replaced with 'Milestone' in
many countries, but most likely these statuses apply to the Milestone
versions, too.

== Testing Instructions ==

Please follow these instructions if your device isn't listed, or if it
needs its information updated.  Working or not, please comment on
issue 54 and include the full name of your device along with what you
found.

If the app can determine on its own that your device won't be able to
support the hack (e.g., the `charge_counter` file doesn't exist, as on
the original Droid), then the One-Percent Hack option will be disabled
(grayed-out, unabled to be turned on).  In this case, you've already
reached the end of testing, but please let me know in issue 54.

If the option is not disabled (that is, if you are able to turn it
on), please turn it on.  Ideally, the app will immediately start
showing your battery level with one-percent increments.  It seems
possible that some devices will show non-multiples of 10, but will
still jump by 10 percent.  E.g., jumping from 65 to 55 to 45 as your
device drains.  _This is probably the most important thing I need to
know_, because if some devices do that, it means the Broadcast isn't
being sent often enough, and I'll have to set up a suboption to poll
at regular intervals.  Because none of my test devices work this way,
_*I need to hear from you if you have a device that does*_.

So if it appears to work, please keep on eye on it for a few hours and
try to verify that it drops fairly regularly at (close to) single
percent increments while discharging (or rises that way while
charging).

Then, let me know in issue 54 what you found.  Thanks!
