== Can I have just the icon without the notification? / Can I have just the notification without the icon? ==

Unfortunately, that's not possible at this time.  In all current
versions of Android, the notification icon and the actual notification
(in the pull-down menu) are tied together. If you try to set a
notification without an icon, the notification doesn't show up, and
the only way to get an icon in the status bar is to set a
notification.  If a future version of Android allows it, I will
definitely add an option to allow people to customize things in this
way.

== Can you make your app replace the stock battery icon? ==

Unfortunately, that's not possible at this time.  If a future version
of Android allows it, I will definitely take advantage of it.

== Can you add more color options for the icon? / Can you make the icon show when the battery is charging? ==

The way Android currently implements notifications is that any icons
you want to put in the status bar _must_ be included in the app.  You
can generate images on the fly in an Android application, and you can
use these images in most parts of your application, but you cannot use
generated images in the status bar.

What this means for Battery Indicator is that I can't make the icon as
customizable as I would like to.  Since I need to include both high
and medium resolution sets of images for every option (grayscale, red,
amber, and green), the app is already over half a megabyte in
size. While it would be easy to add more icons with different colors
and styles, or add a lightning bolt to indicate charging, for example,
this quickly increases the size of the package.  (A bigger package
takes up storage space on people's phones and -- even worse -- uses up
RAM that is generally in short supply.)

Hopefully a future version of Android will allow developers to use
dynamically-generated images in the status bar.  If that happens, then
I will be able to make the icon for Battery Indicator much more
configurable without having to worry about the package size.

== Help!  The app won't download! ==

You need to go to Google for support if you're having any problems
with purchasing, downloading, and/or installing apps from the Android
Market.  They're the ones in control of all of that, so there's not
much I can do to help.  (Once you have Battery Indicator installed, of
course I'm the person to go to for support with the app itself.)

I have noticed, though, that sometimes if the Market app gets stuck
and won't download or install an app, restarting your phone and trying
again can help.  If the problem is with credit card authorization, it
might be that you need to update your credit card on file with Google
Checkout.  (It may be that your expiration date has changed, for
example.)

== Please allow the app to be installed to SD card for Android 2.2+ ==

I hear you.  However, Google is very clear that apps such as Battery
Indicator *should not* allow this^1^.  If I did this, and you moved
Battery Indicator to your SD card, then whenever you unmounted the
card from your phone (by plugging your phone into your computer to
copy files to/from your phone, for example), Battery Indicator would
be closed and would not be restarted until you did so manually.
