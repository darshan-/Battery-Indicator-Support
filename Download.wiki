<h1>Download</h1>

I've always wanted to offer the APK (the runnable version of the app)
to the Pro version on this site, but I've always been a little afraid
it would cost me sales.  Consider this a trial run.

It is definitely best to get the app through the Android Market if
possible, but there are several situations where it might be useful to
download it from here.  For example:

 * If you do not have access to the Android Market in your country, or your are using a custom build of Android without the Android Market.
 * If the price I'm asking in the Android Market is more than you think is fair.
 * If you need more than 15 minutes to decide if the price I'm asking is worth it.

Benefits of downloading from the Android Market include:
 * Automatic updates.
 * You increase the number of dowloads/installs and can rate and review, all of which help my ranking.

If you do download it from here, please
